# FIFA Players Analysis, Market value prediction and clustering.

This repository gathers all pieces of codes we produced to analyse, predict the value and cluster the players from FIFA 23.

## Objective

The goal is to build both a regression model to predict a player's market value and a clustering model to see how the players are ranged per position.

## Dataset

The dataset is built from the [SoFifa](https://sofifa.com/)  website.

## Dependencies

-   The source code is written in Python 3.
-   WARNING : XGBoost installation with pip is currently disabled for Windows. Instructions for Windows users :  [https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build.html)
